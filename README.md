# Hui Lab BridgeVentilator
Given the covid19 pandemic, the Hui Lab is releasing it's current, work-in-progress, ventilator to the public domain in the hopes that someone across the globe may be able to use this repository to build emergency bridge ventilators. These makeshift ventilators are designed to alleviate stress on the global healthcare workforce and potentially save lives using simple, readily available, materials. This ventilator that can be built using a:
- Standard plastic 3D printer
- A 4-5 inch wheel
- Ambu bag
- Servo motor or car windshield wiper motor

We're presenting two options for users to recreate this device, one using a car motor and one using a servo motor. The car motor is a Cardon 85-3000 Wiper Motor, one that is used in a toyota camry and that anyone can salvage from a local car junkyard, or their own car if urgent. Alternatively, a servo motor can be used (to do: find specs).

## Assembling the Device
There are 4 3D printed parts:
- The motor bracket mount (or servo bracket if using servo motor)
- The motor bracket stand
- Motor-wheel arm
- Servo Horn (if using servo motor)
- Ambu bag holder

This repository is a fork from The Milner Lab at UT Austin, who initially designed this method of actuating an ambu bag for autmoatic patient ventillation. This is also a work in progress, so feedback is welcome on how the design can be improved, but we also encourage forking of the repository and people to improve on the design in whatever way best serves their purposes. We currently have a list of issues and things we need to do to further test the device which we may be able to get to in the near future but encourage others to test these issues for themselves.

## Current Issues
- Need to perform testing to determine average time to failure for the system and determine failure points.
- Need to perform human factors assessment of the design to facilitate use among a wide audience of users.
