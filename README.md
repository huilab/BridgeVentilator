# Hui Lab BridgeVentilator
Given the covid19 pandemic, the Hui Lab is releasing it's current, work-in-progress, ventilator to the public domain in the hopes that someone across the globe may be able to use this repository to build emergency bridge ventilators. These ventilators are designed to alleviate the stress on the global healthcare workforce and potentially save more lives using a range of readily available materials that makers can harness. This ventilator that can be built using a:
- Standard plastic 3D printer
- A wheel
- Ambu bag
- Servo motor or car windshield wiper motor

This repository is a fork from The Milner Lab at UT Austin, who initially designed this method of actuating an ambu bag for autmoatic patient ventillation. This is also a work in progress, so feedback is welcome on how the design can be improved, but we also encourage forking of the repository and people to improve on the design in whatever way best serves their purposes. We currently have a list of issues and things we need to do to further test the device which we may be able to get to in the near future but encourage others to test these issues for themselves.



## Current Issues
- Need to perform testing to determine average time to failure for the system and determine failure points.
- Need to perform human factors assessment of the design to facilitate use among a wide audience of users.
